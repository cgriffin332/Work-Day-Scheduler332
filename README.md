# Work-Day-Scheduler332

## Description

In this project, I have created a daily work day scheduler that allows the user to save their events for each hour of the work day.  This app will run in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery and Moment.js.

https://cgriffin332.github.io/Work-Day-Scheduler332/

## Usage

When the webpage loads, the user is presented with a work day scheduler, complete with the current date and time slots for each hour of the work day. The time slots are color coded to indicate if the hour slot is in the past(grey), present(red), or future(green).

The user can input their schedule into each text area and save their information by clicking on the corresponding save button.

This information is saved onto local storage, so the info will remain even if the page is refreshed.

If the user wants to remove something from the schedule, simply delete the text and press save again.
